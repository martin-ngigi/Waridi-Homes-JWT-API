1.SETTING UP 
Link - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django
1.1 create a virtual environment named .venv based on your current interpreter:
    # Linux
    sudo apt-get install python3-venv    # If needed
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # macOS
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Windows
    py -3 -m venv .venv
    .venv\scripts\activate

1.2 Activate virtual environment:
    .venv\Scripts\Activate 

1.2 Open the project folder in VS Code by running code ., or by running VS Code and using the File > Open Folder command.
1.3 In VS Code, open the Command Palette (View > Command Palette or (Ctrl+Shift+P)). Then select the Python: Select Interpreter command:
1.4 The command presents a list of available interpreters that VS Code can locate automatically (your list will vary; if you don't see the desired interpreter, see Configuring Python environments). From the list, select the virtual environment in your project folder that starts with ./.venv or .\.venv:

1.5 Update pip in the virtual environment by running the following command in the VS Code Terminal:
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip

1.6 Install Django in the virtual environment by running the following command in the VS Code Terminal:
    python -m pip install django

INSTALLATIONS 
Exporting requirements:
	pip freeze > requirements.txt
Installing requirements:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

2.CREATING AND RUNNING DJANGO PROJECT
2.1 Create the Django project
In the VS Code Terminal where your virtual environment is activated, run the following command:
    django-admin startproject project
    
- navigate to mongo_django_project by typing:
    cd project
    
2.2 Create an empty development database by running the following command:
    python manage.py migrate


2.3 To verify the Django project, make sure your virtual environment is activated, then start Django's development server using the command:
     python manage.py runserver

2.4 Ctrl+click the http://127.0.0.1:8000/ URL in the terminal output window to open your default browser to that address.


3. CREATING DJANGO APP
3.1 In the VS Code Terminal with your virtual environment activated, run the administrative utility's startapp command in your project folder (where manage.py resides):
    python manage.py startapp accounts
    python manage.py startapp posts
